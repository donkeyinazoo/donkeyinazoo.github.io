about me [And a little bit about me...]
[I enjoy critically reasoning and debating controversial topics. Topics that particularly interest me are India, education, politics, technology, and economics. I tweet about my thoughts at @debarghya_das.

My Myers-Briggs Type Indicator(MBTI) is INTP [Introverted iNtuitive Thinking Perceiving]. The favorite people I supposedly share my personality type with are Albert Einstein, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. You too should take the test here. As of late '17, I test as an ENTP.

I occasionally write on my blog, Writes whenever I feel like I have something new to add, usually about India, life, code and education. I used to write quite a bit on Quora.

I enjoy hiking, cricket, eating and reading about tech. I'm compiling a list of my favorite books, videos, articles and news sources on the internet in a list called where the knowledge is.

I love Hindi music and have a large Spotify playlist going, cleverly marketed as the Best Hindi Playlist on Spotify. I also like Michael Jackson, music from different countries, and my throwback high school Rock and Metal playlist.

I once lived off coffee, beer, and 5-hour energy shots, often in that order.
Now it's mostly chai, coffee and cheap wine.

About me

Hi, my name is Claudia and I work remotely as a freelance data scientist. I hold a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in science (Business Analytics, VU University Amsterdam).

Since I was young, I have always enjoyed to solve puzzles. So that’s how I look at big data sets: to me it is one big puzzle I want to solve. Finding patterns nobody else sees is the challenge to me.

I have been working as a data scientist for more than ten years with experience in transport, logistics and retail. I have worked for more than 25 companies which gives me the ability to translate complex questions into understandable insights.

Do you want to work together? Please reach out to me by e-mail.

Mission
Turning your data into insights

My name is Ger Inberg, a Dutch data scientist with a background in software engineering.

I work remotely as a freelance data scientist. Getting insights out of data is something that I really like. Data visualization and machine learning are some techniques that I am using to achieve this.
I am a big open source believer since I think with sharing solutions we can achieve a lot more as a community. Therefore I prefer to use R and python for my daily work.

I have a passion for (endurance) sports and healthy living and I would love to help you out if you have a project in those areas!
On my website you can find some examples of my projects, most of them are links to a website or interactive visualization.

Have fun in browsing through the content and thank you for visiting!
